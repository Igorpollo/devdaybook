Hello there! This is a React, Redux and Firebase application.

The idea here is to create a application where a devs can create a account and then, starts to create posts about yours daily dev thoughts and adventures.
Every user have a unique URL, this way you can share your profile.

You can see a demo here [Dev Day-Book](http://devdaybook.surge.sh). And here my [profile](http://devdaybook.surge.sh/gWFjYEaan2UHyKezlyWcyZXFQdM2).
Use this project only for study pruposes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so you just need to ```yarn install``` and ```yarn start```.

You can see there is a ```yarn deploy``` who build and deploys to [Surge](https://surge.sh/), you can do this to runs your own modified version of this project.

Any PR or Tips are welcome.
